# Branch Predictor
Branch prediction is an approach to computer architecture that attempts to mitigate the costs of branching. Branch predication speeds up the processing of branch instructions with CPUs using pipelining. The technique involves only executing certain instructions if certain predicates are true. Branch prediction is typically implemented in hardware using a branch predictor.
Branch prediction is also known as branch predication or simply as predication.

## Branch prediction test methods includes
- Compare between simple n-bit saturating counters or simulate custom branch predictor with the following architecture and choices:
![alt text](assets/general_architecture.png)
- BHT different entry types
    - n-bit saturating counters.
    - n-bit agree predictor 
        - The "Bias Bit Table" displayed would likely be part of the BTB or I-cache.

- Different Indexing methods for BHT
    - PC
    - GHR
    - GHR XOR PC (GShare)
    - PHT entry XOR PC (PShare)
    - PC index PHT, PHT entry index BHT (Local History)
![alt text](assets/indexing_choices.png)
- Input: list of (PC of branch instruction, T or NT)

## Usage and Dependencies
- Tkinter and pillow libraries are necessary.
- and launch/run `main.py` with Python.

- Below is an example simulation of branch prediction with 8-entry branch history table.
![alt text](assets/local_history_example.png)  
- Example text files are provided in `examples/` for simulating branch instructions from a file upload. PC values can be of any length. See [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) for more details.

## Code Description
- [gui_widgets.py](gui_widgets.py) -> Tkinter is Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. tkinter provides us with a variety of common GUI elements which we can use to build out interface â€“ such as buttons, menus and various kind of entry fields and display areas. We call these elements Widgets.
- [predictor_components.py](predictor_components.py) -> here we defined different classes which contains nbitPredictor, nBitAgreePredictor, PatternHistoryRegister and misprediction_rate (Misprediction rate for each predictor, not for each branch instruction). 
- A n-bit predictor: has a improved prediction accuracy and changes prediction only when there are n successful mispredictions. 
- nbitAgreePredictor: a new method of reducing negative branch interference called agree prediction.
- main.py: 
  - Compare simple n-bit saturating counters
  - Simulate a custom branch predictor
  - Choose BHT entry type and counter size
  - Choose BHT indexing method
    - PC,GHR,GShare,PShare,Local History 
  - Choose bits of PC to use for indexing (lowest bit is bit 0)
  - PC: These bits will be used to index BHT
  - GHR: GHR size will be used to index BHT.
  - GShare: GHR will have the same bit size as this range, These bits of PC will be used to XOR GHR to index BHT.
  - Local History: This portion of PC will be used to index PHT. BHT index will have 2^(index size) entries.
  - PShare: PHT index size and BHT index size will be the same as this range, These bits of PC will be used to XOR corresponding PHT entry to index BHT.
  - Simulate_Predictor: Add a branch address (in binary) and actual direction.
